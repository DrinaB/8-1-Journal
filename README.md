# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project invloved creating a C++ prgram that can display both a 12-hour and a 24-hour clock on a website, in compliance with the international standard ISO 8601. 
The problem was to provide a solution to Chada Tech's clients with the option to view time in both formats.
# What did you do particularly well?
I beleive that I was able to simplify my code after debugging. 
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Since my code has beem simplified. I believe that there are not many improvements that need to be made.
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I think that the most challenging parts of writing this code was managing the logic for updating the clocks, especially when it came to handling the transitions between seconds, minutes and hours.
To overcome this challenge, I used resources like Stack Overflow, where i read a few discussions.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I beleive that seeking help through resources like stack overflow has reinforced the importance of utilizing your resources to learn and apply relevant information. 
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I broke down the program into smaller, self-contained functions, each responsible for a specific task. I used descriptive names for variables and functions, such as getHour, formatTime24, and displayClocks, which clearly indicate their purpose. This makes the code more understandable at a glance, both for myself and for anyone else who might work on the code in the future. By focusing on these aspects, I made sure that the program is not only functional but also easy to maintain, read, and adapt as future needs arise.
